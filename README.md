# DATA-STRUCTURES-PRACTISE

**🐍📚**

## Author : Manpreet Kaur

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains all the practise questions from my university subject **Data Structures**. It includes 

easy-to-understand explanations, visual examples, code snippets, and implementations to help with learning and 

revision.

These resources are organized by topic (e.g., `factorial.py`, `fibonacci.py`, `stackADT.py`, etc.) and cover 

topics taught in the Data Structures curriculum — especially **Python implementations** of fundamental 

algorithms and data structures.

## 🗂️ What's Inside

✔️ **Class Illustrations**  
✔️ **Topic-wise files** (like factorial.py, fibonacci.py, stackADT.py, etc.)  
✔️ **Code examples**  
✔️ **Algorithm implementations** and solutions  

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Recursion (Factorial)
- Sequences (Fibonacci)  
- Stack ADT Implementation
- Basic Algorithm Patterns
- Data Structure Fundamentals
- Class examples & exercises

## 🚀 How to Use

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manpreetkaur292006-design/DATA-STRUCTURES-PRACTISE.git
```

**Explore the files**  
Navigate through Python files to view implementations and algorithm examples.

**Run the code**  
Open terminal and run: `python filename.py` to test each implementation.

## 💡 Tips for Learners

- Go through each Python file in order — they follow your course progression.
- Use the implementations for revising concepts before tests or practical assignments.
- Try modifying the code examples to experiment with different inputs and edge cases.
